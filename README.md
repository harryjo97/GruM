# Graph Generation with Diffusion Mixture

Official Code Repository for the paper [Graph Generation with Diffusion Mixture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03596).

In this repository, we implement the *Graph Diffusion Mixture* (GruM).

## Why DruM?

+ Previous diffusion models cannot model the graph topology as they learn to denoise at each step w/o the knowledge of the destination of the generative process.

+ To fix such a myopic behavior, we propose a novel graph generation framework that captures the graph topology by directly predicting the destination of the generative process modeled by a mixture of endpoint-conditioned diffusion processes.

+ Our method significantly outperforms previous graph diffusion models on the generation of diverse real and synthetic graphs, as well as on 2D/3D molecule generation tasks.

## Code structure

We provide <u>two separate projects</u> of DruM for <u>three types of graph generation tasks</u>:

- General graph 
- 2D molecule 
- 3D molecule 

Each projects consists of the following:

```
DruM_2D : Code for general graph generation / 2D molecule generation 
```

```
DruM_3D : Code for 3D molecule generation
```

We provide the details in README.md for each projects.
